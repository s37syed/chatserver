p2p-server
=====

The project was for an intro to Computer Networking course. The goal of the project was to create a multithreaded server, so that multiple clients could connect to it. 

The default port number used was 1025, to create/write to the sockets. You may need to edit the 'port' variables on the P2PServer and P2PClient, or else the program may not work.

To run the server, execute P2PServer after you compile it. Follow the on-screen prompts after.
Clients can connect by compiling and running P2PClient. Follow the on-screen prompts after.

Clients can use /quit (to leave the server), /query (to check how many users are connected), and /time (to view the time you joined the server).
